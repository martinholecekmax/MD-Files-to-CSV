<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Use this 2.4m x 5.0m Double Leaf Palisade Gate to form an entry point so vehicles can access a site. At 5.0m wide, this palisade gate is suitable for allowing forklifts, cars and small vans to drive through. This gate is really practical as it can enable you to grant site access when required, along with keeping your premises protected from intrusion when it is closed. When closed, the gate will effectively unite with the rest of the Palisade Security Fencing structure. To secure it shut you should use the drop bolts and sliding latch bolt supplied with your gate. There is also the option to use a Heavy Duty Padlock to lock the gate completely.</p>
<p>As this palisade gate is 2.4m high, you should install it in areas which need a high level of security in place. This gate, along with your Palisade Security Fencing System, may be constructed on many different types of ground, although you must make sure that you use posts which have the right ground compatibility. This means that Dig-In posts should be employed for palisade gates erected on soft ground and Bolt Down posts should be employed for gates erected on hard ground. You can select your required gate posts when placing your order at the top of this page.</p>

<h2>Features and Manufacture</h2>
<p>This 2.4m x 5.0m Double Leaf Palisade Gate is very robust and sturdy. It is manufactured from steel which has been cold rolled, which ultimately means that the steel has been made more lightweight but without reducing any of its strength. The palisade gate features a number of pales which are all designed in a specific way to help prevent intrusion. The profile of the pales is moulded into a &lsquo;W&rsquo; shape in order to make them hard to grip or gain a footing on. Therefore, potential intruders will find it very difficult to climb over the gate. You can also select Flat, Round, Round and Notched, Single Pointed or Triple Pointed type pales for your palisade gate. Each of these pale types will help to restrict climbing activity; with Pointed pales functioning as a theft deterrent as well. You can also find these options when ordering your Palisade Security Fencing System.</p>
<p>A protective zinc coating is also applied to the palisade gate so that it becomes more protected from rust. This is known as a galvanised finish and it successfully meets the BS EN ISO 1461:2009 standard. We also offer you the opportunity to have your gate polyester powder coated. This type of finish will enable your palisade gate to adopt a brighter appearance through the application of colour and supply your gate with an extra form of protection against corrosion, damage and wear. This finish can be requested in the customisation above. All of these customisable options are also available when choosing your Palisade Security Fencing System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We supply all of our 2.4m x 5.0m Double Leaf Palisade Gates with the standard features of Triple Pointed pales and a galvanised finish. However, you may change this by customising your gate.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gate Kit</h2>
<p>You will receive your 2.4m x 5.0m Double Leaf Gate as an assembly kit. In this kit you will have all of the required components ready for construction, so items will not need to be ordered individually. We do not provide any Postfix cement within our gate kits so if this is needed you should add the required amount to your shopping cart.</p>
<p>To ensure that your 2.4m x 5.0m Double Leaf Palisade Gate meets all of your specific requirements, you can select from a range of customisation options from the order section above.</p>
