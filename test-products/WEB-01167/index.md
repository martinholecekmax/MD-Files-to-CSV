<h3>The Gate Package</h3>
<p>This gate package comes with the gate itself, the posts, the pales and all the anti-vandal shear of nuts and bolts. Also if you purchase three or more gates you will get a 5% discount off your gates.</p>
<p>The palisade gates are all made in our workshop which is located in Burton upon Trent in the midlands.&nbsp; As we are located in the midlands this gives us fast access and delivery times to all parts of the country.</p>
<p>After the gates have been fabricated they are then galvanised to give a very tough and long lasting finish. If then you require a further finish they powder coated in the colour of your choice.&nbsp; Have the fence and gates in a colour to suit the environment or your corporate image can have a very positive impact for you current and future customers.</p>
<h3>Lighter and Stronger</h3>
<p>We &ldquo;<strong>cold roll</strong>&rdquo; all of the pales used in our palisade gates. This gives them extra strength and at the same time making them lighter and stronger.</p>
<h3>Custom Built</h3>
<p>In our fabrication factory we can offer you a custom build of your gates if required. If you need a non-normal gate or automatic locking etc. <strong>please get in touch</strong></p>
