<h2>Function</h2>
<p>This 3.0m x 10.0m Double Leaf Palisade Gate, along with your Palisade Security Fencing System is very useful if an entry point is required for a site that needs to grant access to vehicles like vans and HGV&rsquo;s. By installing this type of palisade gate, you will be able to control your site&rsquo;s accessibility and keep your premises safe from intrusion when work is not taking place. The gate contains two gate leaves which, when closed together, make up a total width of 10.0m. To hold the palisade gate in place when it is shut, the sliding latch bolt should be shifted across and the drop bolts inserted into the ground below. To secure your palisade fencing and gate even further, you can use a Heavy Duty Padlock and this can be obtained as a customisation option.</p>
<p>You can use this palisade gate in many different locations, however at 3.0m high this gate is considered more appropriate for areas requiring very high security measures in place. Bolt Down Posts or Dig-In Posts may be used to erect this palisade gate, although the type of posts you use will depend on the ground type that you choose to erect the security fencing and palisade gate on. So, for soft ground types you will need to use Dig-In Posts along with Postfix cement, but for hard ground types you will need to use Bolt Down Posts. You will be able to select your required gate posts when you place your order above.</p>

<h2>Features and Manufacture</h2>
<p>With a high level of strength and rigidity, this 3.0m x 10.0m Double Leaf Palisade Gate can provide fantastic safety and security. Manufactured from steel, the palisade gate undergoes a cold rolling process to form its unique shape. The purpose of cold rolling is to make the steel thinner and lighter in weight, but without affecting its strength in any way. There are a number of pales that make up the construction of this gate and each of these are designed to prevent climbing and intrusion. Firstly, the pales have a &lsquo;W&rsquo; shaped profile which is very hard to grip onto. Secondly, the head of each pale features a Single Pointed, Triple Pointed, Flat, Round or Round and Notched shape and this helps to restrict anyone attempting to scale the palisade gate. As this type of gate is a popular choice for high security areas, it is recommended that Triple Pointed pales are used as they provide theft deterrence through their imposing appearance. You can also find these options when ordering your Palisade Security Fencing System.</p>
<p>This palisade gate is coated with a layer of zinc to help prevent it from rusting. This is called galvanisation and this type of finish complies with the BS EN ISO 1461:2009 standard. Polyester Powder Coating finishes are also available for this type of gate. By choosing this type of finish, your palisade gate will have better protection from damage and the effects of weathering, as well as becoming more colourful and attractive for the area in which it will stand. Polyester Powder Coating is available in a wide range of colours. All of these options are also available when choosing your Palisade Security Fencing System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We provide all 3.0m x 10.0m Double Leaf Palisade Gates with a standard galvanised finish and with Triple Pointed pales, however you can opt for alternative pales or a polyester powder coated finish by completing the customisation section at the top of this page.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gate Kit</h2>
<p>Your gate order will be supplied to you as a kit. In your kit you will receive all of the required components for construction including posts, pales, fixing bolts and the gate frame to fit into your Palisade Security Fencing System. No Postfix cement will be provided in your kit so this should be ordered separately if needed.</p>
<p>This product can be customised in several ways which means that you can tailor your palisade gate to meet all your specific requirements. When you place your gate order you will be able to choose your preferred pales, posts, finish or obtain a Heavy Duty Padlock.</p>
