<h3>This Palisade Gate System</h3>
<p>This gate is suitable for use with large vehicles as well as being able to allow two lanes of small vehicles to pass through. This makes it ideal for busy sites as people in cars can come in and out at the same time. The gate is a Double Leaf gate meaning that it comprises of two 3.0m gates that meet in the middle.</p>
<p>Very often when people are planning and plotting their perimeter fencing they very often forget to allow the right sort of gates for the traffic needed.</p>
<h3>Our Palisade Gates</h3>
<p>These gates are made by our own fabricators. This gate is a standard gate with a sliding bolt. The gate is made here on site in our workshop and then they are sent off to be galvanised. Then when they return to us they are either checked off by our quality control team or they are forwarded to be powder coated / painted.</p>
<h3>Custom Built</h3>
<p>Please give us a call on 01283 512111 or drop us an email if you require a non-standard palisade gate set.&nbsp; As we build all of our gates in our factory we can offer you our team of expert designers and fabricators to build the gates to suite you requirements.</p>
<h3>Extra strength</h3>
<p>The pales used in our Palisade Gates are manufactured by the process of cold rolling. This gives the pales extra strength while making them thinner and lighter than a normal pale.</p>
